# E-commerce Project (1/2): Admin dashboard and backend

This is first part of my e-commerce project where I build from scratch an e-commerce platform in two parts: (1) Dashboard and backend to support multiple shops that can be connected to it, (2) Online shop connected to dashboard and backend.

You can find the second part of my E-commerce project (the online shop connected to this dashboard) here:
