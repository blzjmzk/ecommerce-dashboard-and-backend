# E-commerce Project (1/2): Admin dashboard and backend

You can find second part of my E-commerce project (the shop page) here: (link)

Dashboard and backend built from scratch in Next.js. The dashboard allows you to manage multiple connected shops. You can add products and their properties (colours, sizes), as well as banners. It also collects data on all orders and their status (paid/unpaid).

## Stack:

- Full stack application built in Next.js and TypeScript
- Authentication using Clerc
- Client-side state management (modals) using Zustand
- Forms using React Hook Form and Zod
- Database connection using Prisma ORM (db: MySql, hosted on Aiven)
- Styling: Shadcn/ui
