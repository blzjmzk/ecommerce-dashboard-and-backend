# E-commerce Project (1/2): Admin dashboard and backend

This is part of my e-commerce project where I am building a dashboard and backend from scratch to support multiple shops that can be connected to it. You can find second part of my E-commerce project (the shop page connected to this dashboard and backend) here:

[https://github.com/blzjmzk/ecommerce-store](https://github.com/blzjmzk/ecommerce-store)

Dashboard and backend built from scratch in Next.js. The dashboard allows you to manage multiple connected shops. You can add products and their properties (colours, sizes), as well as banners. It also collects data on all orders and their status (paid/unpaid). On the first page it displays statistics concerning orders.

## Stack:

- Full stack application built in Next.js and TypeScript
- Authentication using Clerc
- Client-side state management (modals) using Zustand
- Database connection using Prisma ORM (db: MySql, hosted on Aiven)
- Forms using React Hook Form and Zod
- charts with Recharts
- Styling: Shadcn/ui
